  "description": "Sends the msg through the first output after the set timer duration. If a new msg is received before the timer has ended, it will replace the existing msg and the timer will be restarted, unless the new msg has a payload of 'stop' or 'STOP', in which case it will stop the timer. The second output allows you to send an additional payload of a number, string or boolean. If the timer is stopped, the second output will automatically send a payload of 'stopped'.",
