  name: Zigbee2MQTT 2.0.0 IKEA STRYBAR 4 Button Remote Actions
  description: 'This blueprint enables easy configuration of actions for the four
    possible button presses (clicks and holds/long-presses) on the IKEA STRYBAR 4
    button remote.

    Tested on E2002 remote but it should also work with E2001. Naming follows the
    convention provided by [Zigbee2MQTT IKEA E2001/E2002](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/E2001_E2002.html).

    Notably the release action on the bottom small light button is not currently included
    in this blueprint.  The exposed action "brightness_stop" duplicates the top large
    light button and the MQTT package is identical. This can be addressed by monitoring
    which button was held, possibly using helpers, though this requires additional
    configuration.

    Thanks to [Christoph Schorn](https://github.com/chrschorn) for writing [TRÃ…DFRI
    remote blueprint](https://gist.github.com/chrschorn/64acf5f8b692f1177c04681cbee49bbf)
    which I slightly modified for compatibility with the STRYBAR remote. '
